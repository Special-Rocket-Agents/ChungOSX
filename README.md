# FAQ
### Q: Why do I get an IndexError running a command?
A: Probably because you haven't provided an argument for it... or just a general bug
### Q: Upon pressing enter on the prompt, It switches to ChungOS and my terminal constantly, Why?
A: The exact bug is unknown but, Ctrl+C and re-enter - You should be good from there!
### Q: How do I run programs in `/data/programs`?
A: Put a dot at the start of the command, then your file name without the `.py` and you should be good!
### Q: For some reasons I need to simulate an error.
A: `raise <errorcode>` - The existing error codes exist in a class named `errors()`
