# CHUNGOS IS ~~NOW DIS~~CONTINUED
This ~~shitty~~ OS is basically a ~~hole and was never~~ good ~~any~~thing. This readme was ~~cringe miserable and my programming style was~~ shit. I'll go read-~~only~~ and this project will ~~never~~ be revived.


Thank you ~~to nobody~~ who was on this wonderful right


Yours truly.
